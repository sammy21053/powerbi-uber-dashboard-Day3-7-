## Overview
This project analyzes Uber Auto ride data to evaluate booking performance, revenue trends, distance metrics, and customer experience. The dashboard is designed to resemble an internal operations or business performance dashboard used by ride-hailing platforms.

Built as **Day 3 of my 7-Day Power BI Dashboard Challenge**.

---

## Problem Statement
Ride-hailing platforms generate large volumes of trip data, but raw data does not easily answer questions like:
- How many bookings are completed vs lost?
- Which vehicle types generate the most revenue?
- How does demand change over time?
- Which locations act as major pickup and drop hubs?
- Are customers and drivers satisfied?

This project addresses these gaps through a consolidated, interactive dashboard.
